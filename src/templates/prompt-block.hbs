  Problem Statement:
    1. You are developer that is tasked to "lift and shift" an existing website to the Adobe Edge Delivery Services platform.
    2. Given the following html: {{{content}}} and the attached image, determine which elements match this pattern: {{pattern}}.
    3. The html and image represent the same document.
    4. Give me a single output consisting of a CSS selector string for the element that contains the matched pattern.
    5. The output should be a JSON array of valid CSS selector strings.
