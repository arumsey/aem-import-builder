  Problem Statement:
    1. You are developer that is tasked to migrate an existing website to the Adobe Edge Delivery Services platform.
    2. Given the following html: {{{content}}}, please write a function that will find elements and add them as a two-dimensional array.
    3. The elements you are looking for are: {{pattern}}
    4. The function you write should be called "export default function parse(element, { document })", where element is the root element and document is the html document object.
    5. To provide better context the element matching a selector of "{{selector}}" in the html content will be the same element passed into the function.
    6. Give me one output that will be a Javascript function that returns the two-dimensional array.
  Output Javascript Requirements:
    1. The two-dimensional array is meant to represent cells in a table. The first array are the rows and then the second array in each row are the column cells.
    2. Unless specified assume all elements you find should be added to the first column in the first row.
    3. Use the element.querySelector or element.querySelectorAll methods to find elements in the "export default function parse(element, { document })" function.
    4. When elements should be placed in the same cell, add them all to a new array first and then add that array to the two-dimensional array.
    5. When including an element in a cell use the element reference and not "outerHTML" or "innerHTML".
    6. All queries for elements you are looking for must use the element variable passed into the function.
    7. Use your knowledge of the html content and the selector matching the element variable to build better queries.
